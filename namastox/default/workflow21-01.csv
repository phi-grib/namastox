A0001	BB001_01	text	Problem formulation	TASK	Enter a description of the problem formulation, which is is aimed at defining the purpose and scope of a risk assessment and the depth of the analysis. Please include the relevant regulation(s) that must be considered if an assessment is required for regulatory purposes. Also include the envisaged exposure scenario(s), the substance definition, etc. Give an indication on the level/uncertainty limits of the desired information. If possible: specify the areas of toxicity (knowledge gap to be filled), the level of need for mechanistic understanding and potential exit points (sufficient information reached) 	expert	"- National Research Council. 2009.

A0002	BB002_01	text	Relevant existing data for substance of interest?	TASK	Search for available physicochemical, toxicological, mechanistic and toxicokinetic data about this compound in existing data sources. Compile all available data on exposure levels. Provide a transparent information overview, based on these data.	expert		A0003		
A0003	DP01EF_01	bool	Information sufficient?	LOGICAL	Justify if existing data is sufficient for answering the question posed in the Problem Formulation. If information is considered sufficient (Yes), record the basis for this decision. If information is considered insufficient, specify the knowledge gaps or remaining uncertainties.	 			A0004	A0005
A0004	BB003_01	value	Derive Point-of-Departure POD	TASK	Compile all data from assays considered to be predictive of hazard. For each assay, determine concentration dependency of the effect, fit a function through the data points and determine the minimum concentration, at which hazard may be triggered (BMC or BMCL). Give a rationale why and how this BMC has been chosen. Compile all BMCs and determine which of them is considered most relevant. This one is termed PoD. Give a rationale for the choice and indicate the uncertainty of the decision. Decide (and justify) whether a single PoD is chosen or whether multiple PoD are chosen. In the latter case decide and justify whether the multiple PoD are collapsed to a single value (variance) is chosen, or whether work is continued with a distribution function of PoD.	expert		Z0001

A0005	DP02EF_01	bool	Is read-across applicable?	LOGICAL	Consider read-across as alternative approach for addressing the regulatory question(s) at hand. Justify in the application of read-accross can answer the question posed in the Problem Formulation.				A0006	A0008
A0006	WF01_01	text	Perform dedicated workflow for NAM-based read-across  	TASK	Make use of existing data (in vivo, in vitro, etc.) to carry out read-across, using grouping or analogue approaches. Depending on the regulatory context the following guidelines could be useful (it).	in silico		A0007		
A0007	DP03EF_01	bool	Information sufficient?	LOGICAL	Justify if existing data is sufficient for answering the question posed in the Problem Formulation. If information is considered sufficient (Yes), record the basis for this decision. If information is considered insufficient, specify the knowledge gaps or remaining uncertainties.				A0004	A0008
A0008	BB040_01	text	Identify data gap and testing strategy based on problem formulation	TASK	Consider whether the regulatory question(s) at hand can be addressed using NAMs. If so, outline necessary steps for hazard, ADME and exposure, where appropriate.	expert		A0009		
A0009	DP04EF_01	bool	Is NAM -based testing feasible for the substance of interest?	LOGICAL	"Evaluate if the substance of interest has physico-chemical properties, which would interfere with its testing in the proposed NAMs methods coming from BB040

H0001	BB008_01	value	Generate in silico predictions of hazard	TASK	Generate QSAR predictions for relevant bioactivity (e.g. AOP MIE or other KEs) and hazard (AOP AO). Use the query compound as input for a panel of QSAR models (e.g. collected at DTU). Ideally use various panels/tools.	in silico	local_models	H0002,H0004		
B0011	DP05EF_01	bool	Compound mainly cleared by metabolism?	LOGICAL	An assessment of the major clearance mechanism of the compound (metabolism vs renal vs biliary excretion unchanged. Document the (1) criteria that have been considered for the decision; (2) data that have been used; (3) effect thresholds considered relevant; (4) thresholds of certainty required for data used; (5) discussion points and possibly consistency checks that have been important for the decision. With evolution of NAMASTOX, increasing levels of guidance on above points will be incorporated in this decision point.				W0001	B0001
E0001	BB022_01	text	Screen possible exposure scenarios	TASK	Screening possible exposure scenarios involves systematically identifying and evaluating situations where individuals or the environment might come into contact with a substance on factors sources/pathways, volume distribution, target population (workers, consumers, general population), data/quantification. Collecting data of most suitable exposure modelling scenarios/available measurement data. Example questions to be answered: Description of possible sources and routes, resulting in a description of multiple scenarios. What is the target population (workers, consumers, general population)? Data availability search.	expert		E0002
