(2) Document the	Use the query compound as input for a panel of computational models (e.g. collected at DTU). Ideally use multiple panels/tools.  The reason for using these panels tools should be justified, based on relevance for the problem formulation and an ability to determine the confidence in the model and thus its applicability for the compound of interest. Such panels of models could include Danish QSAR database, OECD toolbox, as opensource systems, Vegahub as well as commecrical options. Use of multiple models may strengthen the weight of evidence or quality of the prediction. If using multiple models for an endpoint define upfront how these will be combined and interpreted. eg consensus, majority etc.	Results from the model(s) predictions(s)l should align to the base requirements as laid out by the OCED Model prediction reporting template https://one.oecd.org/document/ENV/CBC/MONO(2023)32/ANN2/en/pdf.  Key considerations should include relevant information that supports or justifies the interpretation of the result.  Whether it is categorical active/ in active and inform on how the uncertainty related to the model prediction is defined, - is it quantitative or qualitative, whether the alert is present/ how often/ is the compound within the applicability domain. Final output should summarise findings -justify why findings maybe disregarded due to low confidence and the keys findings that will be addressed and/or followed up in subsequent NAMs relevant to the endpoint defined for the problem formulation. Large data sets may be generated (hundreds or thousands of models). They are difficult to interpret as such. Interpretation becomes more robust, if additional generation is provided on model reliability, or applicability domain and on overlap of results from different models. Some models may also provide more explanatory output. All such information is beneficial for ranking and next steps. A transparent display is important/mandatory; naked excel files with loads of abbreviations are of little use.			H0002,H0003		
H0002	BB011_02	text	Identify bioactivity	TASK	Conduct an in vitro screen using high-throughput assays to identify and characterise the compounds MoA and/or dose response for the relevant endpoint(s) related to the problem formulation and any prior knowledge or from in silico models. <br>The assays including data processing should meet a defined criteria for applicability domain, concentration range and biological coverage as well as technical robustness, to ensure a low probability of missing bioactivity that could cause adverse effects. 	 Use an assembly of independent assays that broadly characterize bioactivity of the compound being assessed over a sufficient concentration range relevant to the problem formulation or justify a selective assay set based on knowledge of defined MoAs. Concentration range of the assays should be chosen and account for the potential exposure scenario, and cover determination of no effect levels as well as a clear justification for the top dose chosen based on either a multiple of predicted cMAX (30x), solubility or cytotoxicity limits. The compound under consideration should fit within the defined applicability domains of the assays utilised.  Assays can be from commercial or other sources and should be performed to an available standard operating procedure (SOPs, ToxTemp, OECD GD) including results from defined positive and negative controls to ensure assay performance can be evaluated.  Document the outputs from the assays, including an evaluation of data quality, providing overall result classification. Justification of how the assays address metabolic relevance should be addressed.  For quantitative POD determination values, provision of reproducibility data or estimation of variability (Eg BMDU/L or SD) in should be available as well as raw data and graphs showing curve fits. Include the data interpretation method for 1) how a quantitative POD analysis has been performed or 2) how a positive/negative classification has been defined as well as the software used.  Incorporate reasoning for use of software, and version and how the POD relates to the activity for example AC50/AC20 values BMD/ BMDL value. Examples for such assays include but are not limited to broad non targeted coverage - Cell Painting and high throughput transcriptomics (HTTr), cytotoxicity and stress reporter assays including ToxTracker, where as assays related to more specific MIEs include for example receptor/protein binding assays such as Calux binding assays or functional assays such as LHUMES dendrite outgrowth test.
