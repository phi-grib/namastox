H0001	BB010_01	text	Generate toxicologically-relevant in silico predictions of hazard	TASK	(1) Use QSAR models (and other available computational methods) for predictions of relevant bioactivity (e.g. toxicological targets), of toxicological endpoints (e.g. genotoxicity) or of events that may be associated to AOP (MIE, KE, AO). (2) Document the model, its prediction, the strength of predicition (or uncertainty), if possible the potency range, and performance parameters of the model.	Use the query compound as input for a panel of computational models (e.g. collected at DTU). Ideally use multiple panels/tools.  The reason for using these panels tools should be justified, based on relevance for the problem formulation and an ability to determine the confidence in the model and thus its applicability for the compound of interest. Such panels of models could include Danish QSAR database, OECD toolbox, as opensource systems, Vegahub as well as commecrical options. Use of multiple models may strengthen the weight of evidence or quality of the prediction. If using multiple models for an endpoint define upfront how these will be combined and interpreted. eg consensus, majority etc.	 (AW - input for guidance - that can be extended by Eva and team) Results from the model(s) predictions(s)l should align to the base requirements as laid out by the OCED Model prediction reporting template https://one.oecd.org/document/ENV/CBC/MONO(2023)32/ANN2/en/pdf.  Key considerations should include relevant information that supports or justifies the interpretation of the result.  Whether it is categorical active/ in active and inform on how the uncertainty related to the model prediction is defined, - is it quantitative or qualitative, whether the alert is present/ how often/ is the compound within the applicability domain. Final output should summarise findings -justify why findings maybe disgarded due to low confidence and the keys findings that will be addressed and/or followed up in subsequent NAMs relevant to the endpoint defined for the problem formulation. Large data sets may be generated (hundreds or thousands of models). They are difficult to interpret as such. Iterpretation becomes more robust, if additional generation is provided on model reliability, or applicability domain and on overlap of results from different models. Some models may also provide more explanatory output. All such informaton is beneficial for ranking and next steps. A transparent display is important/mandatory; naked excel files with loads of abbreviations are of little use.	Input for target interaction are only the query compound properties/structure. For RAx, source compounds are an additional input, together with a solid rationale why these source compounds have been selected.	H0002	 	 	BB011

"Perform the required number of biological and technical replicates and different concentrations as described in the assay specification (e.g. ToxTemp). Determine concentration ranges with no effect, potentially specific effects, and of general cytotoxicity. Document the outputs from the assays providing overall result classification, quantitative values an evaluation of data quality as well as variability, such as standard deviation or BMDL and uncertainty considerations. For concentration-response data, provide graphs within the reports for each assay.
Include the data interpretation method for 1) how a quantitative POD analysis has been performed or 2) how a positive/negative classification has been defined as well as the software used.  Incorporate reasoning for use of software, and version and how the POD relates to the activity for example AC50/AC20 values BMD/ BMDL value.
Assay requirements are as follows. Assays can be from commercial or other sources, but they all should be highly reliable and transparently descibed (including a clear  standard operating procedure). All test compound data must be accompanied by suitable  positive and negative control data. The assay performance needs to be documented; assay readiness status depends on the problem formulation, but need to be indicated in all cases.
Example for such assays (RH3R version of ASPA) are stress reporter assays including ToxTracker, Calux receptor binding assays, cytotoxicity assays in 3 cell lines (proliferating HepG2, LUHMES, RPTEC), and a Tempo-SEQ HTTr assays in PHH cells and RPTEC.

Assays have met and are performed at a technical readiness level that is sufficient to provide confidence in the determined end result whether this is qualitative or quantifiable. Additional considerations should include dose range performed - in vitro assays cover the expected exposure predicted from PBPK, range extends up to solubility limits, cytotox limits or 500uM/ 100x cMax and that these are greater than expected internal exposure.

LOGICAL	Assess whether an external exposure estimate is available and evaluate its quality to determine whether it is sufficient as an initial worst-case estimate for translation into an internal concentration. This internal concentration can then serve as a guide for setting testing concentrations in in vitro studies (DP06EF).	"When evaluating the quality of an external exposure estimate, some important quality criteria might include:
1. Relevance: Is the estimate based on data/scenarios that are representative of the actual use conditions and populations of interest?
2. Transparency and Documentation: Are the data sources, assumptions, and calculation methods clearly described and justified?
3. Data Source Reliability: Are the underlying data from reputable, validated, and recent sources (e.g., peer-reviewed literature, regulatory databases)?
4. Completeness: Are all relevant exposure routes, sources, and populations considered, or are there significant gaps?
5. Accuracy and Precision: Is the estimate based on measured data, modeled data, or expert judgment? Are uncertainty and variability addressed or quantified?
6. Temporal and Spatial Relevance: Are the data and scenarios current and geographically appropriate?
7. Peer Review or Validation: Has the method or estimate been subject to peer review or external validation?
8. Applicability for Purpose: Is the estimate suitable as a worst-case scenario for the intended translation to internal concentrations and in vitro testing?"				X0002	E0005	DP14

The resulting estimates will serve as input for high-content in vitro data interpretation and high-throughput PBK modeling.	"Calculate the highest (worst-case) exposure for target population(s) and relevant source(s) and route(s) by combining the collected data with absorption efficiency, taking into account factors such as frequency and duration of exposure. Apply worst-case assumptions and use low-input screening exposure models (such as ECETOC TRA or MEASE) or sum the maximum allowed concentrations from available sources. Assume maximal exposure durations (e.g., full-shift for workers or full-day for consumers) and frequencies (e.g., performing the highest-exposure task all day, or simultaneous use of all relevant products in one day). Use these assumptions to ensure conservative (protective) exposure estimates. The resulting estimates will serve as input for high-content in vitro data interpretation and high-throughput PBK modeling.
