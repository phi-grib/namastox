A0001	BB001_01	text	Problem formulation	TASK	Enter a description of the problem formulation, include the envisaged exposure scenario(s), the regulatory context, the compound definition, etc. Give an indication on the level/uncertainty limits of the desired information. If possible: specify the areas of toxicity (knowledge gap to be filled), the level of need for mechanistic understanding and potential exit points (sufficient information reached)	expert		A0002		
A0002	BB002_01	text	Relevant existing data for substance of interest?	TASK	Search for available physicochemical, toxicological, mechanistic and toxicokinetic data about this compound in existing data sources. Compile all available data on exposure levels. Provide a transparent information overview, based on these data. 	expert	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/,https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard/	A0003

A0004	BB017_01	value	Derive Point-of-Departure POD	TASK	Compile all data from assays considered to be predictive of hazard. For each assay, determine concentration dependency of the effect, fit a function through the data points and determine the minimum concentration, at which hazard may be triggered (=BMC or BMCL). Give a rationale why and how this BMC has been chosen. Compile all BMCs and determine which of them is considered most relevant. This one is termed PoD. Give a rationale for the choice and indicate the uncertainty of the decision. Decide (and justify) whether a single PoD is chosen or whether multiple PoD are chosen. In the latter case decide and justify whehter the multiple PoD are collapsed to a a single value (Â± variance) is chosen, or whether work is continued with a distribution function of PoD	expert		Z0001

A0008	BB020_01	value	Generate NAM data based on read-across hypothesis 	TASK	Consider how much additional information is needed to support the Rax hypothesis, concerning similar (extrapolable) (1) main effect (target-related toxicity); (2) effect on other targets; (3) toxicokinetic behaviour (e.g. metabolite formation, distribution, etc..). Compile NAM that would allow to derive the desired data or to increase the confidence that the Rax hypothesis is correct for this question (1-3). Perform NAM testing of source and target compounds, compile the data and provide a conclusion on whether the RAx hypothesis has been strengthened, confirmed or possibly disproved.	in vitro		A0009

H0002	BB009_01	value	Generate high-throughput in vitro data	TASK	Use an assembly of assays that broadly characterize bioactivity of the compound at question over a large concentration range. Example for such assays (RH3R version of ASPA) are stress reporter assays, luciferase signal transduction assays, cytotoxicity assays in 3 cell lines (proliferating HepG2, LUHMES, RPTEC), and a transcrptomic assay in HepG2 cells. [Possibly expand the battery by an assay for AChE activity, a MEA assay and a metabolic activation assay (PHH)]. Determine concentration ranges with no effect, potentially specific effects, and of general cytotoxicity. Use various routines to identify relevant modes of action (for toxicity), based on bioactivity data.	in vitro		H0003
